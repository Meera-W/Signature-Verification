PROJECT NAME : Signature Verification

GROUP MEMBERS :   Gauri Shewale - 191071068
		Vaishnavi Bhadrashette - 191071016
		Meera Wadher - 191071076

Python Tools/Libraries Used : Python OpenCV Library for Image Processing
		                   Python Numpy Library for Computational Operation on Image
			 SIFT Algorithm - Scale Invariant Feature Transformation

Project Description : A project based on image comparison, which uses the SIFT Algorithm for 
                                      verifying input signature image with the images present in the dataset. Using this algorithm, percentage of 
 		 similarities between the signatures are noted, thus helping to identify the authenticity of the signatures.
